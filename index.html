      <div class="about-me__body">
        <p>
          As a tech and science enthusiast, I have always loved knowing how the
          universe works and how I can help to improve people's lives. This
          passion led me to choose a career as a science teacher (physics,
          mathematics and robotics). After a few years of robotics teaching, I
          realised that I had great potential to contribute to the tech
          industry. Confident that the skills and expertise I developed add
          quite well to the tech career, I decided to migrate to it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started my studies in front-end web development with the famous
          triad: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Nowadays, I am fully engaged in
          React, keeping Next.js and Typescript on my radar.
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, feel free to check out my portfolio. I'm still in the beginning,
          but there's already a lot of affection and dedication involved. If you
          liked what you saw, get in touch. I am always available to help, share
          and learn.

              regular job, whose daily routine could be forever changed. The
              options are underlined with dots within the story itself. Just

            <h2>The begin</h2>
            As the sun peeks through the curtains, John awakens to a new day. He
            stretches, rises from bed, and heads to the bathroom. <br />
            After a refreshing shower, he brushes his teeth and heads downstairs
            for breakfast. <br />
            At the table, he faces a choice: indulge in
            <span id="sb__toPage2" class="sb__blueDots">
              two toast slices with scrambled eggs and coffee </span
            >, or savor a
            <span id="sb__toPage3" class="sb__yellowDots"
              >traditional English Breakfast</span
            >. What will he choose?
          </div>
          <div id="sb__page2" class="sb__hidden">
            <h2>A Common Breakfast</h2>
            With a hankering for simplicity, John opts for two slices of toast
            adorned with fluffy scrambled eggs and a steaming cup of coffee.<br />Satisfied,
            he heads upstairs to dress for the day. In his neatly pressed
            attire, he departs for work.<br />Upon arrival, he's met with an
            unexpected glitch: the main elevator is out of order. A decision
            awaits him. Should he take the more convenient but distant
            <span id="sb__toPage4" class="sb__blueDots">service elevator</span>, or
            embrace some exercise by
            <span id="sb__toPage5" class="sb__yellowDots">climbing the stairs</span>?
            The choice is his to make.
          </div>
          <div id="sb__page3" class="sb__hidden">
            <h2>A Hearty English Breakfast</h2>
            Opting for tradition, John indulges in a hearty English Breakfast
            complete with sizzling sausages, crispy bacon, baked beans, grilled
            tomatoes, and a sunny-side-up egg. The meal takes a bit longer,
            making him realize he's running slightly behind schedule.<br />He
            hurries to dress and heads off to work. Arriving at the office, he's
            met with a surprise obstacle: the main elevator is out of order.<br />A
            decision presents itself. Should he opt for the more distant
            <span id="sb__toPage6" class="sb__blueDots">service elevator</span>, or take
            the opportunity to squeeze in some exercise by
            <span id="sb__toPage4-2" class="sb__yellowDots">climbing the stairs</span>?
            The choice is his to make.
          </div>
          <div id="sb__page4" class="sb__hidden">
            <h2>A Slightly Late Arrival</h2>
            Despite his slight delay, John arrives at the office. He heads to
            his desk and begins his work for the day. His boss notices his
            arrival but doesn't seem particularly concerned.<br />In passing,
            the boss mentions the main elevator being out of order, almost as if
            it's a casual topic.<br />Before John can respond, the boss adds,
            "Oh, and by the way, don't forget to submit that report by the end
            of the day." With that, the boss walks away, leaving John to his
            tasks.<br />The day progresses quite normally. Meetings, emails, and
            tasks fill his hours. As lunchtime approaches, John faces another
            choice. Should he opt for a quick bite in the
            <span id="sb__toPage7" class="sb__blueDots">company cafeteria</span>, or
            should he take a short walk to the
            <span id="sb__toPage8" class="sb__yellowDots">restaurant nearby</span>? The
            decision is his to make, and it might just shape the rest of his
            day.
          </div>
          <div id="sb__page5" class="sb__hidden">
            <h2>An Early Arrival</h2>
            John takes the stairs and, unexpectedly, arrives at the office about
            5 minutes earlier than usual. To his surprise, his boss has also
            just arrived and is quite subtly impressed by John's punctuality.<br />"Good
            morning, John. You're here a bit early today, I see," the boss
            remarks with a hint of surprise.<br />The boss then continues, "By
            the way, did I ever tell you about the time my wife convinced me to
            try that new restaurant downtown? Let's just say the food wasn't the
            only thing that left me feeling uneasy."<br />The boss chuckles,
            clearly finding the memory amusing. "Anyway, it's been a while since
            we had a laugh about that. Enjoy your day, John."<br />The day
            unfolds much like usual. Meetings, tasks, and emails occupy John's
            time. As lunchtime approaches, he faces a decision: should he dine
            in the
            <span id="sb__toPage7-2" class="sb__blueDots">company cafeteria</span>, or
            venture to the
            <span id="sb__toPage8-2" class="sb__yellowDots">restaurant nearby</span>?
            Given the extra time he gained by arriving early, the thought of a
            more elaborate meal at the restaurant crosses his mind. The choice
            is his to make, and it might just shape the rest of his day.
          </div>
          <div id="sb__page6" class="sb__hidden">
            <h2>A Late Arrival</h2>
            John, having been delayed, arrives at the office nearly 25 minutes
            behind schedule. As he steps out of the service elevator, his boss's
            demeanor is less welcoming than usual.<br />The boss's tone remains
            polite, but there's an unmistakable edge to it. "John, I hope you're
            aware of the time," the boss states, raising an eyebrow.<br />"Punctuality
            is crucial in this workplace." Before John can respond, the boss
            continues, "And speaking of expectations, I trust you remember the
            report that needs to be submitted by the end of the day. I shouldn't
            need to remind you of its importance."<br />With that, the boss
            walks away, leaving John to contemplate the implications of his
            tardiness.<br />Given the significant delay, John's lunchtime choice
            is limited. He heads to the
            <span id="sb__toPage7-3" class="sb__blueDots">company cafeteria</span> for a
            quick meal, knowing that he has much to catch up on during the
            afternoon.
          </div>
          <div id="sb__page7" class="sb__hidden">
            <h2>Lunch in the Company Cafeteria</h2>
            John decides to keep things simple and heads to the company
            cafeteria for lunch.<br />He enjoys a quick meal, catching up with a
            few colleagues during the break. The cafeteria is bustling with
            activity, and the familiar sights and sounds create a sense of
            routine.<br />After lunch, John resumes his work, tackling tasks and
            participating in a few meetings. The afternoon passes uneventfully,
            and as the workday draws to a close, he packs up his things and
            heads home.<br />The journey back mirrors any other day a bus ride,
            a podcast to keep him company, and the comfort of his home awaiting
            him.<br />
            The evening unfolds in typical adult fashion cooking dinner,
            catching up on chores, and maybe squeezing in a bit of relaxation.
            As the day winds down, John reflects on the choices he made and the
            twists his day took, realizing that even in the routine, there's
            room for the unexpected.<br />And with that, our story comes to a
            close. <br />
          </div>
          <div id="sb__page8" class="sb__hidden">
            <h2>An Unexpected Reunion</h2>
            As John enters the restaurant, he spots a familiar face from long
            ago. It takes him a moment to recognize her, an old friend from his
            school days, someone he used to have a crush on but never confessed
            his feelings to. Years have passed, and he had almost forgotten
            about her.<br />A spark of recognition lights up within John, and he
            decides to seize the chance to reconnect. Approaching her table, he
            greets her with a warm smile. "Is that you? It's been ages!" he
            exclaims, a touch of surprise and nostalgia in his voice.<br />They
            both laugh, reminiscing about their shared memories. After
            exchanging pleasantries, John shares the unusual circumstances of
            their reunion, leading to a lengthy conversation over lunch. He
            learns that she also works nearby and lives not far from him. They
            discuss how the hustle and bustle of life can cause people who live
            and work in close proximity to go years without noticing each other,
            despite having known each other in the past.<br />As conversation
            flows, John takes a bold step. He proposes that they catch up
            properly and suggests going out for dinner sometime. She smiles
            warmly and agrees, and he feels a mixture of excitement and
            anticipation. With the promise of a future dinner, they part ways
            for now, carrying with them the intrigue of rekindled connections
            and the possibility of something more.<br />Before saying goodbye,
            John says, "How about we go out for dinner soon? There are a couple
            of great options nearby. There's a
            <span id="sb__toPage9" class="sb__blueDots">Chinese restaurant</span> close
            to work, or we could try a
            <span id="sb__toPage10" class="sb__yellowDots">Brazilian restaurant</span>
            near where I live. What do you think?" They exchange a curious
            glance, both pondering the delicious choices ahead.
          </div>
          <div id="sb__page9" class="sb__hidden">
            <h2>A Chinese Culinary Adventure</h2>
            A few days later, John and his friend, Emily, meet up at the Chinese
            restaurant he suggested.<br />As they step inside, she's immediately
            captivated by the intricate decor and the enticing aroma of the
            cuisine. The evening proves to be a delightful culinary adventure,
            with plates of diverse dishes satisfying their palates.<br />The
            conversation flows effortlessly, and they share stories, laughter,
            and moments of connection. Emily recounts her own experiences, the
            places she's traveled to, and her passions in life.<br />John finds
            himself intrigued by her stories, and the hours slip away unnoticed.
            By the end of the evening, they've both thoroughly enjoyed the
            experience. As they part ways, they agree that they should meet
            again soon. The promise of more encounters hangs in the air.<br />Looking
            back, John marvels at how simple decisions in the routine of an
            ordinary day can completely alter the course of one's life.<br />The
            choice of a breakfast, the unexpected reunion, and the decision to
            reconnect, all these seemingly minor actions have led to something
            beautiful. In the weeks that follow, their connection deepens.<br />They
            continue to spend time together, discovering shared interests and
            values. It's not long before their feelings for each other become
            undeniable.<br />A couple of years down the line, they take a
            significant step, getting married.<br />Their journey, sparked by
            the seemingly ordinary decisions of a single day, evolves into a
            beautiful partnership. The chance encounter that brought them
            together serves as a testament to the unpredictable yet wonderful
            nature of life.<br />
            And so, the story of John's adult day adventure finds its
            conclusion, as two people embark on a new adventure together,
            creating their own story of happiness and love. <br />

          <div id="sb__page10" class="sb__hidden">
            <h2>A Brazilian Gastronomic Experience</h2>
            On another day, John and Emily decide to explore the Brazilian
            restaurant near his home.<br />As they enter, Emily's eyes light up
            at the vibrant atmosphere, the energetic music, and the rich aroma
            of Brazilian cuisine. The restaurant staff warmly welcome them, and
            she is impressed by their hospitality.<br />The two friends delve
            into the diverse menu, savoring each bite of the flavorful dishes.
            Their conversation flows naturally, with stories and laughter
            filling the air.<br />Emily, in particular, is taken by the lively
            music playing in the background, and she even joins in humming a
            tune. The evening concludes on a high note, with both of them having
            thoroughly enjoyed the Brazilian culinary experience.<br />As they
            part ways, they express excitement about the possibility of more
            adventures together.<br />
            Reflecting on their time spent, John recognizes once again the
            remarkable power of simple decisions in shaping the course of one's
            life. From breakfast choices to unexpected reunions and shared
            moments like these, every action holds the potential for something
            wonderful.<br />In the weeks that follow, their connection deepens
            further. They continue to spend time together, growing closer with
            each passing day. Before long, their feelings become undeniable.<br />A
            couple of years later, they take a significant step, getting
            married.<br />Their journey, ignited by the unassuming decisions of
            an ordinary day, evolves into a beautiful partnership. The chance
            encounter that brought them together stands as a testament to the
            serendipitous and beautiful nature of life.<br />And so, the story
            of John's adult day adventure finds its conclusion, as two people
            embark on a new adventure together, weaving their own tale of
            happiness and love. <br />
